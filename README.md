# lab-pandas-II

## Introduction

In the lesson of Introduction to Pandas, we learned about new methods of this library. In addition we are now able to scroll through a dataset, as well as manipulate by apply and groupby a data frame.

The goal of this lab is to help you practice the concepts learned in the lesson and give you some hands-on experience working with Pandas.

Remember to keep the order and to leave a good commentary on the whole lab. 

Don't forget to let your imagination run free. We want you to practice your storytelling. Next class day you will have 5 minutes to present it to your classmates. 


As a bonus you should make some graphs that add some value to your presentation. 

## Getting Started

Now you should already be familiar with the workflow of solving and submitting the labs. But in case not, review the guidelines in the `README.md` in the [repo root](../..) and [previous lab](../lab-pandas).

In this lab you will be working on [main.ipynb](your-code/main.ipynb). To launch it, first navigate to the directory that contains `main.ipynb` in Terminal, then execute `jupyter notebook`. In the webpage that is automatically opened, click the `main.ipynb` link to launch it.

When you are on `main.ipynb`, read the instructions for each cell and provide your answers. Make sure to test your answers in each cell and save. Jupyter Notebook should automatically save your work progress. But it's a good idea to periodically save your work manually just in case.

## Deliverables

- `main.ipynb` with your responses to each of the exercises.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
